Making Life Easier
==================

  In order to make it easier to develop a Rails application,  I am making this code available for any of your application needs.  It is a basic User authentication, and management system using the following Gems:
  
  * Rails 3.0.7
  * Authlogic
  * Declarative Authorization

  The system provides the ability to add, delete, and edit current users,  Add roles for each specific user, and declare permission for those roles.  It also has "Forgot Password" functionality, and login and log out functionality.  Hope you enjoy it.  If you would like to know more about The tools used for this project,  check out the following screencasts.
  
  * Authlogic - http://railscasts.com/episodes/160-authlogic
  * Declarative Authorization - http://railscasts.com/episodes/188-declarative-authorization
